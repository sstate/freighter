# Freighter

A flux storage mixin for reactjs components.

#### Install

`npm install freighter`

#### Use

Until we get some documentation, you can check out the example directory. Although you could use this with other
flux implementations, [lcars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lcars) and [cargo-bay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cargo-bay) work really nice with this mixin.

#### Run examples

```
npm install

npm run examples
```

#### Run tests

```
npm install

npm test
```
